    <p>Allu Arjun (born 8 April 1982) is an Indian actor who works in Telugu cinema. One of the highest-paid actors in Indian cinema,[1] Allu Arjun has been featured in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list since 2014.[2] He is a recipient of several awards including a National Film Award, six Filmfare Awards, and three Nandi Awards.[3] He is considered to be one of the finest dancers in Indian cinema.[4] He is popularly referred to as "Stylish Star" and "Icon Star".[5]

In 2008, he starred in the romantic drama Parugu for which he won his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.[7]
        <p>He then starred in Puri Jagannadh's action film Desamuduru in which he played the role of Bala Govindam, a fearless journalist who falls for a woman with a darker past.[39] The film was a commercial success, fetching him a Santosham Film Award, a CineMAA Award and his second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.[40] The same year, he made his second cameo appearance alongside Chiranjeevi, in the song "Jagadeka Veerudiki" from the film Shankar Dada Zindabad.

            His next film was Bhaskar's Parugu, where he played the role of Krishna, a happy-go-lucky man from Hyderabad who helps his friend to elope with his love, only to experience the wrath of the woman's father and the emotional struggle he felt. Idlebrain wrote: "Allu Arjun is pretty excellent in the first half as the characterization in the first half is vibrant and needs loads of energy. He carried the entire first half on his shoulders. He excelled in the emotional scenes in the second half."[41] Writing for Rediff.com, Radhikha Rajamani stated that "Arjun performs well though he is rather subdued."[42] Allu Arjun won his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu and his second Nandi Special Jury Award.
            
            Allu Arjun next starred in Sukumar's action comedy Arya 2.

The film revolved around the complexities of love–hate relationships and love triangles.[43] His character in the film had shades of grey.[44] Sify wrote that "Allu Arjun is full of energy as the guy caught in the powerful current of love. Though he plays the part with negative shades, his characterization could evoke a lot of sympathy from the audiences. His dances are mind-blowing and he excels in emotional scenes."[45] Oneindia appreciated his dance moves and acting performances, especially the comedy scenes.[46] He received his fourth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu for his performance in the film.
